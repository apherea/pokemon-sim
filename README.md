## Pokemon Battle Simulator

## Update Notes
## 9/26/2023 (First iteration)
This project is the backend for a Pokemon Battle Emulator that copies all the traits of typical pokemon games including typing, supereffective damage, PP (power points), and more. Currently, each Pokemon has to be created manually, so I'd like to add a feature to auto add Pokemon which would most likely require making a database of all Pokemon.
